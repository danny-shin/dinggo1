# Nginx Configuration Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-28 17:20

## Issue

The initial deployment showed the default "Welcome to nginx!" page because we were using the standard `nginx:alpine` image, which does not contain our custom Laravel configuration (proxying to PHP-FPM).

## Solution

We created a custom Nginx Docker image that includes our `default.conf`.

### Steps Taken

1.  **Created Dockerfile:** `docker/production/nginx/Dockerfile`
    - Copies `default.conf` to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.
2.  **Created ECR Repo:** Added `dinggo-nginx` repository in `terra/ecr.tf`.
3.  **Updated Build Script:** Updated `build_and_push.ps1` to build and push the `dinggo-nginx` image.
4.  **Updated ECS:** Updated `terra/ecs.tf` to use the new custom Nginx image.

## Verification

1.  Wait a few minutes for the ECS service to update and the new task to start.
2.  Refresh your browser at `http://<PUBLIC_IP>`.
3.  You should now see your Laravel application.

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the old page:

- **Clear Cache:** Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5).
- **Check ECS:** Ensure the new task definition revision is active and running in the AWS Console.
